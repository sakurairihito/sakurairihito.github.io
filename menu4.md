# Current interest 

My research is based on applying quantum technology to various fields, such as solid-state physics, finance, chemical reaction dynamics, and fluid dynamics.
At the core of my current research is designing and implementing information reduction techniques with the aid of tensor network learning algorithms. 
In my approach, it is important to decompose the algorithm into a learning step and a step for quick and accurate evaluation.
This method is widely applied, from image classification learning parametric differential equations to parametric option prices.
As a result, various tasks, such as real-time computation and stress testing, can be performed more efficiently.

# Current interest 

My research applies quantum information technologies to fields like quantum many-body systems, fluid dynamics, and mathematical finance, especially using tensor networks for efficient data compression. 
By splitting algorithms into learning (offline) and evaluation phases (online), I achieve faster and accurate results in tasks such as option pricing in mathematical finance.

# Current interest 

My research applies quantum information technology to fields like physics, finance, and fluid dynamics, using tensor networks for efficient data compression. 
By splitting algorithms into learning and evaluation phases, I achieve faster, accurate results in tasks such as option pricing and stress testing.

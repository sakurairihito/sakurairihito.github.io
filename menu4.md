# Current interest 

My research spans the intersection of quantum information technology and various fields. I have applied quantum techniques to diverse areas including solid-state physics, finance, chemical reaction dynamics, and fluid dynamics. 
At the core of my current research is the design and implementation of information compression techniques using tensor network learning algorithms. 
The key to my approach is decomposing the algorithms into learning steps and steps for rapid and accurate evaluation. 
This method has been widely applied, from image classification to learning parametric differential equations and parametric option pricing. 
As a result, various tasks such as real-time calculations (such as option pricing in finance) and stress testing and so on can be performed more efficiently.

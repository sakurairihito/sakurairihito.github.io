# Current interest 

My research applies quantum information technologies to fields like quantum physics, finance, especially using tensor networks for efficient data compression. 
By splitting algorithms into learning (offline) and evaluation phases (online), I achieve faster and accurate results in tasks such as option pricing in mathematical finance.

## Software

1. [QCMaterialNew](https://github.com/sakurairihito/QCMaterialNew)"Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for quantum impurity problems", 

2. [Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Calculation by IPT](https://spm-lab.github.io/sparse-ir-tutorial/src/DMFT_IPT_jl.html)

3. [Tensor train learning for derivative option pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02804)ã€€



## Computational ideas that I like

- Do heavy tasks on quantum and easy task on classical!

- Compression based on scale separation

- Offline-online decompositions

- Save now, decrypt later
